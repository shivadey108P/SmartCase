# SmartCase

SmartCase is an innovative application designed to streamline automated test case generation and efficient resource management for software development teams. By leveraging AI-driven functionalities and cloud platforms, SmartCase enhances the testing process and optimizes resource tracking.

## Features

- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Create test cases based on user-defined parameters and templates.
- **Resource Management**: Effectively manage project resources with integration to cloud storage solutions like Google Drive, SharePoint, and OneDrive.
- **AI Integration**: Utilize the OpenAI API for intelligent query handling and data analysis.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality for users.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize resource usage and project analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
